The Greek term for philosophy, or Philosophia, means “love of wisdom.” So, it’s no surprise that students pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) postgraduate degree must have a passion for learning and continuing their education.

Many PhD students have a full schedule with course work, graduate training, and working on their dissertation, which leaves little time for a job to help pay for graduate school.

That’s why it’s important to look to university, organizational, and professional group scholarships to help cover tuition and the cost of living. Check out this directory of scholarships for Ph.D. students, and apply for awards today.
